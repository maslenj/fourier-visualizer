## About

This project is intended to show a basic visual representation about how Fourier Transforms can be used detect the presence of specific frquencies in signals. To simplify things, in this project users can choose three overlapping frequencies which will be used to create a function. This function is then put into the Fourier Transform which is displayer in the bottom half of the screen (only the imaginary part of the Fourier Transform is shown). As can be seen, the Fourier Transform spikes at each frequency which was inputted into the original signal.
